# Clinical Guidelines for Diabetes Management

## Overview

These guidelines provide evidence-based recommendations for the management of Type 2 diabetes mellitus in adult patients.

## Diagnosis Criteria

Diabetes is diagnosed when:
- Fasting plasma glucose ≥ 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L)
- 2-hour plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) during OGTT
- HbA1c ≥ 6.5% (48 mmol/mol)
- Random plasma glucose ≥ 200 mg/dL with symptoms

## Treatment Recommendations

### First-line Treatment
- Metformin is the preferred initial medication
- Starting dose: 500mg twice daily with meals
- Maximum dose: 2000mg daily

### Second-line Treatment
- Add sulfonylurea, DPP-4 inhibitor, or GLP-1 agonist
- Consider patient factors: weight, hypoglycemia risk, cost

### Lifestyle Modifications
- Weight loss of 5-10% if overweight
- Regular physical activity (150 minutes/week)
- Mediterranean or low-carb diet
- Blood glucose monitoring

## Monitoring

- HbA1c every 3-6 months
- Annual eye and foot examinations
- Lipid profile annually
- Kidney function monitoring

## Complications Management

### Cardiovascular Disease
- Statin therapy for patients over 40
- ACE inhibitors for hypertension
- Aspirin for secondary prevention

### Diabetic Nephropathy
- ACE inhibitors or ARBs
- Blood pressure target <130/80 mmHg
- Protein restriction if advanced

### Diabetic Retinopathy
- Annual dilated eye exams
- Laser therapy for proliferative retinopathy
- Anti-VEGF injections for macular edema

## Patient Education

Comprehensive diabetes education should include:
- Self-monitoring of blood glucose
- Recognition of hypoglycemia symptoms
- Proper medication administration
- Foot care and inspection
- When to contact healthcare providers
